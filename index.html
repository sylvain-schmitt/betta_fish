                <h3>Betta splendens</h3>
                <p>Species of the genus <em> Betta </em> are all considered "fighting" fish. The genus is widely made popular by the <em> Betta splendens </em> which is to this day one of the most well-known species in the aquarist world. </p>
                <p> In 2019, the <em> Betta </em> genus includes 73 species described, several of which were in the 2000s, proof that new discoveries are still to be expected in this group. All species are found in Southeast Asia, including the Indonesian islands. </p>
                <p> The large number of species can be explained by several factors. On the one hand, the hot and humid climate characteristic of the region has offered various niches and habitats. These include streams, rivers, lakes and boggy marshes. Several species have adapted to conditions of extreme acidity, with pH down to 3. These conditions correspond to black water in tropical forests. Some <em> Betta </em> are endemic to very limited areas, demarcated by mountain ranges or large rivers. </p>
                <p> As with many fish, color changes with maturity, sex, breeding conditions and geographic variations. Old specimens darken, making the body and operculum patterns difficult to distinguish. Juveniles often have a different physiognomy from adults. There are different groups, among others, the <em> B groups. coccina </em>, <em> B. foerschi </em>, <em> B. pugnax </em>, <em> B. splendens </em>, <em> B. bellica </em> and <em> B. unimaculata </em>. These last two are easily differentiated by the shape of the head. </p>
                <p> Most species reproduce either by making a bubble nest or by mouth incubation.

                <h3>Specificities</h3>
                <p> The fighter is a fish that should be kept in specific aquarium. Its ability to breathe at the surface makes it more inclined to live in small volumes. Naturally, the fighter often finds himself alone for long periods in water holes where oxygen is scarce. A container of 15 liters is sufficient to consider its breeding. </p>
                <p> Associating it with other species is not fundamentally impossible but a documentation work is necessary for the constitution of population. The species appreciates a environment particularly rich in vegetation. The addition of plants will give him many hiding places that will alleviate his possible stress. Floating plants of the type <em> Pistia </em> or <em> Salvinia </em> </span> can be added for recreate the subdued atmosphere characteristic of its living conditions in the wild. </p>
                <p> It is important not to mix different species of <em> Betta </em> in order to avoid the risks of hybridization and to ensure the conservation of only one and same strain. </p>
                <p>Be careful, the fighting fish is an excellent jumper, naturally using this ability to change areas of life or to escape predators. The aquarium must be perfectly covered to prevent it from making a fatal jump ...</p>
